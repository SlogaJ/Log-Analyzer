#Log-Analyzer
The Log Checker allows the user to open a file depiciting apache http logs like "203.0.113.10 - - [16/May/2025:09:28:47] "GET /search?q=admin HTTP/1.1" 200 1050" and formats it in a clean and readable way.

This code allows the user to input search filters for status code, http method, and ip's. It then looks through a log file that is provided by the user for anything that matches the set filters and then shows the results.
